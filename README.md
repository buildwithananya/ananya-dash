Hi folks, I’m Ananya 👩‍💻

Building software that’s efficient, reliable, and elegant. I explore Java, .NET, SQL, and DS Algorithms, and I love turning ideas into real solutions.

Outside coding, I’m curious about system design, learning new tech, and solving tricky problems.
When not debugging, you’ll find me reading, travelling, or honing my drawing skills.

I’m driven by curiosity and a love for learning, so if you’re excited about exploring the latest trends and tech, let’s connect!
